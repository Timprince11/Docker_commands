IMAGES  

What's an Image: App binaries and dependencies for your app and the metadata on how to run it.

docker history mysql = To see what was added while building the image 
docker image inspect mysql = To see all about the image. 

docker image ls - To see all your images  
docker image tag < existing image > < new name of image >:<tag> = Image has to be existing on your repo  

docker image push < image/tag > = Image has to be exisiting on your repo  

================== DOCKERFILE ====================
ENV: For environment variables. The main way we set keys and values for container building. That's because they work on all OS. 

RUN: To run shell scripts 

RUN: 
Docker can handle logs. We need to point the logs to "stdout" and "stderr" -> We can forward requests and error logs to docker log collector.  

WORKDIR: Used to chage dir (Better than using RUN cd /some/path)..saves time and creates less confusion

EXPOSE(for ports): The ports will not be open automatically. This is dont to expose the ports on the docker virtual network  
                   -p is still needed to open/forward the ports on the host  

CMD: command that will be run anytime we startup a container or restart a container  
=================================================================================== 

## Note: Keep what changes the least at the top og your dockerfile and what changes the least at the bottom of the dockerfile. 


docker image build -t <name of your image:<tag>> .
