docker image insoect mysql -- you'll see the vol path from the dockerfile 

docker container run -d --name mysql3 -e MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=True -v mysql-db:/var/lib/mysql mysql - Named volumes(gives the vol a friendly name)

Bind mount 
Maps a host file or directory to a container file or directory 
Basically two locations pointing to the same files 
they are host specific, that's why u can only use them in a Dockerfile but in a run command.  

docker container run -d --name nginx -p 80:80 -v $(pwd):/usr/share/nginx/html nginx - Mapping the volume to the pwd (BIND MOUNT) 
Note: nginx already has a html path which you replaced with your own html path
