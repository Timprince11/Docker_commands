docker service create --name psql --network mydrupal -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypass postgres
docker service create --name drupal --network mydrupal -p 80:80 drupal 
docker service ls - Do this multiple times after the previous commands to see the power of the VP and Routing mesh power
watch docker service ls -- To constantly run your service commands to see if ther are any differences.
