It is divided into two parts 

===== YAML formatted file: 
Describes solution options for 
- Containers 
- Networks 
- Volumes  

======= CLI tool (docker-compose) 
used for local dev/test automation with the YAML files  

Example of a compose file (This file replaces the shell script)

services:  # containers. same as docker run
  servicename: # a friendly name. this is also DNS name inside network
    image: # Optional if you use build:
    command: # Optional, replace the default CMD specified by the image
    environment: # Optional, same as -e in docker run
    volumes: # Optional, same as -v in docker run
  servicename2:

volumes: # Optional, same as docker volume create

networks: # Optional, same as docker network create 

Docker Compose CLI 

Not a prod-grade tool but Ideal for local dev and test 
Most Common commands are: 
docker-compose up #setup volumes /networks and start all containers 
docker-compose down #stop all containers and remove cont/vol/net  

docker compose down -v = removes volumes built with docker compose file  

docker compose build -  

docker compose up --build -
